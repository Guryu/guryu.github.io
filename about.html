			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<h2>Our mission is to create a better place to debate and discuss online.</h2>
			<p>Discussing and debating anything online doesn't fair well. Social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. And when you do have a discussion, conversations quickly turn into opinion sharing, flame wars and personal attacks.</p>
			<p>We're building a moderated community to foster thought-provoking, high-quality debate among users. </p>
			<p>Here's our <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/MEBEQIPUS">current prototype</a>. This project is run by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rohittigga.com/">Rohit Tigga</a>. Please email him at <a  target="_blank" href="mailto:rohitrtigga@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20I'd like to help" target="_top">rohitrtigga@gmail.com</a> if you have any feedback or would like to help. We would love to hear from anyone!</p>
